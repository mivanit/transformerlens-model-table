This is a utility for viewing all models available in the [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) package as a nice table, which you can view at [`miv.name/transformerlens-model-table/`](https://miv.name/transformerlens-model-table/).

You can also get the table as:
- [jsonlines](docs/model_table.jsonl)
- [csv](docs/model_table.csv)
- [markdown](docs/model_table.md)
- a Pandas dataframe -- see the code in [`demo.ipynb`](demo.ipynb)

The data for all of these should update daily at midnight UTC. If this appears not to have worked, or if there has been a new TransformerLens release and you want to force an update sooner, make any comment on [this issue](https://github.com/mivanit/transformerlens-model-table/issues/1) and the action should run automatically.
